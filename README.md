This is my stash of miscellaneous scripts and accoutrements. It is a work in progress. 
Additions are made when I find scripts I've squirelled away in google drive and emailed myself over time.

Special thanks to @xkcd. Although we've never met, his seminal piece **Is It Worth the Time?** inspired me to bring this collection together.
[![Is It Worth the Time?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png "Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now.")](https://xkcd.com/1205/)
